## Disclaimer
Each project has a detailed description written as comments in **Latvian**.

## How to Run

**Disclaimer**
The only files relevant to these projects are the C++ source files (.cpp). Other folders or files generated by the CLion during the build process are automatically created and do not serve any purpose for running or understanding the code. You can safely ignore them.

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Save each project code in a separate .cpp file.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the files.
4. Open your terminal or IDE, navigate to the folder containing the .cpp files.
5. Compile each project using a command like:
   ```g++ -o project1 project1.cpp
   ```
6. Run the compiled .exe programme.
