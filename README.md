# 🏫Ventspils Augstskola School Projects

This repository showcases a collection of C++ and Python projects, organized by date and topic. The goal of this repository is to showcase the skills and knowledge I've gained throughout my first year as a Computer Science student.

## 📂 Project Structure

Projects are named using the following format: ```date```_```programming language/s```-```project name```.

Each project includes its own `README.md` with a full explanation, features, and setup instructions.
## 🌟 Notable Projects

Here are some highlights from the repository:

- [**2024-10_Python-Comparing_Sorting_Algorithms**](https://github.com/Rihards-Irbe/VeA-Projects/tree/master/2024-10_Python_comparing-sorting-algorithms) – A Python terminal based tool for measuring and comparing sorting algorithms performance. Includes configurable settings, execution time graphs, and more.
- [**2025-1_Python_djkstar-algorithm**](https://github.com/Rihards-Irbe/VeA-Projects/tree/master/2025-1_Python_djkstar-algorithm) - A Python program that calculates the shortest path between Latvian cities using **Dijkstr's algorithm**. Supports custom distance data via Excel.

## 📌 Note

The first year of the Computer Science program at Ventspils Augstskola places a strong emphasis on mathematics and theoretical foundations. Programming assignments are mostly introductory, designed to accommodate students with little to no prior experience. As a result, the projects in this repository focus on fundamental concepts rather than complex or advanced software development.
